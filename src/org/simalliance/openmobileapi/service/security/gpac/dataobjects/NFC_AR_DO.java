/**
 * NFC-AR-DO:
 * In the NFC use case, mobile device application gather information 
 * from their associated card application using the SE access API. 
 * However, when the card application needs to trigger its associated mobile application, 
 * it sends an HCI EVT_TRANSACTION according to ETSI TS 102 622 [102 622] over SWP to the device. 
 * This event is handled by the NFC chipset stack which has to start 
 * the corresponding device application. Disclosure of this event to malicious applications 
 * can lead to phishing and denial of service attacks.
 * To prevent this, it shall be possible to use the applications signature to authorize 
 * device applications to receive HCI events issued by the secure element application.
 * An NFC event data object defines an access rule for generating NFC events for 
 * a specific terminal application. The NFC event access can be restricted by a rule based 
 * on an event access is NEVER/ ALWAYS allowed policy.
